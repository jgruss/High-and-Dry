# High and Dry

Welcome to High and Dry.  This is a standalone web application that helps you
predict weather conditions at a particular location for a given amount of time.
I use it to find good places for rock climbing, but you may find it useful for
other things too.

## Usage

Simply clone the repository:

    git clone git://github.com/jgruss/high-and-dry.git

And point your brower to the html page `HD_1.html`.  From there just enter the
location you're interested in, weather data is loaded, and a slider is
presented that allows you to fine-tune the times you're interested in.
